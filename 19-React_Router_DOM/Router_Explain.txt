Run this in Terminal :
npm i react-router-dom


Types Of Routers :


BrowserRouter :

BrowserRouter uses the HTML5 History API to manage routing in the browser.
It works using Client-Side Routing, which means the page does not reload when navigating between routes.

This router stores the navigation history in the browser and gives clean, normal URLs.
It is the most common and basic router used in React applications.

You can make simple routing like this :

portfolio.com = /
portfolio.com/about = /about
portfolio.com/contact = /contact

Example :

<BrowserRouter>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
    <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
    <Route path="/contact" element={<Contact />} />
  </Routes>
</BrowserRouter>


HashRouter :

HashRouter uses the URL hash (#) to handle routing.
It does NOT use the History API.

The route comes after the # symbol, so the server is never involved in routing.

This router is useful when the hosting server does not support client-side routing
(like GitHub Pages).

URLs look like this :

portfolio.com/#/
portfolio.com/#/about
portfolio.com/#/contact

Example :

<HashRouter>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
    <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
    <Route path="/contact" element={<Contact />} />
  </Routes>
</HashRouter>


MemoryRouter :

MemoryRouter stores the routing history in memory, not in the browser URL.

The URL does not change at all when navigating between routes.

This router is mainly used for testing or in environments where there is no browser
(like React Native).

Key Points :

- No visible URL changes
- History exists only in memory
- Mostly used in testing

Example :

<MemoryRouter>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
  </Routes>
</MemoryRouter>


StaticRouter :

StaticRouter is mainly used for Server-Side Rendering (SSR).

It does not use browser APIs and does not allow navigation on the client side.

Routes are fixed and rendered based on the provided location.

This router is used on the server, not in normal client-side React apps.

Key Points :

- Used for SSR
- No client-side navigation
- Requires a fixed location

Example :

<StaticRouter location="/about">
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
  </Routes>
</StaticRouter>


Summary :

BrowserRouter  -> Most common, clean URLs, client-side routing
HashRouter     -> Uses #, good for static hosting
MemoryRouter   -> No URL change, mainly for testing
StaticRouter   -> Used for server-side rendering
